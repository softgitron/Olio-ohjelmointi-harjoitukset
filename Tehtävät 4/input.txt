ODE TO A QUEUE
by

Leonard Kleinrock
  
In the 20 years of funding
Many fields has DARPA led.
Was the analytic thread.
By that I mean they nurtured
Quantitative research tools.
Indeed a wealth of knowledge
Was uncovered and was new.
Was the analytic queue!
In a quiet Poisson stream.
If you want to model networks
Or a complex data flow
And wonder what to do,
Of an analytic queue!
